### Hi there my name is Simone and I am a junior developer passionate about online security and new forms of data management including the blockchain. I started my career in Environmental Science and have a passion for clean tech. My next projects include a writing portfolio, music website, and building my first smart contracts. Looking forward to collaborating with other talented developers to see what we can create.
